The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/labs/lab_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Labs\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `labs/lab_1/` folder structure.

Although my white census tract did have high margins of error as well, the ratio was significantly lower. I noticed that factors such as size and how far away it was from a major city may impact reliability. The census tracks with higher margins of error in my white population were more concentrated in Erie County than they were in King's county which represents Brooklyn, NYC. I suspect that more rural areas with sparser populations do not contain as much reliable data. In addition, it is likely that smaller tracts have higher margins of error as one error would account for majority of the variability due to the small population size. Before the Department of Human Services issue out resources for their outreach program, they need to assess how many people are really in need of the services and up to which percentage of margin of error they are willing to accept. By creating an index, like done in this analysis, the department will be able to assess the inaccuracies across the geography. This margin of error should be cross referenced or normalized by total population. For example, a margin of error of 50% looks very different in a total population of 10 the  people vs 10,000. Because Hamilton County only has two census tracts, I propose that they invest in having one or two employees take a new count of residents in order to best allocate funding across where people live. Overall, it is clear there is variability in data accuracy across racial groups and rural or urban groups. Further investigation will be needed to assess whether or not the invariability is concentrated in these racial groups or if majority of these racial groups are located in areas where due to their distance from an urban hub, their data is unreliable. \n\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\nrecommendations<- NY_census_cleaned_reliability %>% \n  select(NAME, median_incomeE, moe_per_income, reliability) %>% \n  mutate(algorithm_rec= case_when(reliability==\"High Confidence\" ~ \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\", reliability==\"Moderate\"~ \"Use with caution -

Results would change for example if a stricter margin of error to not surpass was chosen. \n\n\n**Limitations:**\n[Note any limitations in your analysis - sample size issues, geographic scope, temporal factors, etc.]\nLimitations of my analysis include a more robust comparison between urban and rural areas to understand if the true inequity arises from geogrpahical location or racial group. \n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
